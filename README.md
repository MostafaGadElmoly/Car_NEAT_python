# NEAT Simulation

## Overview
PyCar is a simulation application that uses the Pygame library to control a car in a simulated environment. The application features collision detection, a radar system for navigation, and NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) for learning optimal driving strategies.

## Features
- **Realistic Car Control**: Simulate driving a car with realistic controls and responses.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions with the environment to prevent the car from driving through obstacles.
- **Radar Navigation System**: Utilize a radar-based system to navigate through the environment by detecting obstacles.
- **NEAT Integration**: Apply NEAT algorithms to evolve driving strategies over generations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python
- Colors (custom module, ensure it is provided or installable)

## Installation
To run PyCar, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using pip:
